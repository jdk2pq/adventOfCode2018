Recognized this being pretty similar to [Day 12](https://github.com/jdk2pq/adventOfCode2018/tree/master/day12) and wrote a pretty similar solution to solve it.

Only thing that tripped me up was instead of trying to subtract 577, I tried to mod 577 originally. That worked for the first 576 answers after 577, but then failed for 1154 (obviously). Realized I should've been subtracting the whole time and got the right answer!
