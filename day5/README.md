# Day 5

# Part 1

    ts-node part1.ts
    
Part 1 is inefficient, but only took ~ 8 seconds to run on my machine, so I'm okay with that.

# Part 2

    ts-node part1.ts
    
Part 2 is _really inefficient_. But it works. On the test input, it only took 2 seconds. Not bad. But on the given input for the problem, it took enough time for me to add and write up this README, as well as set up the initial structure of the READMEs for the other days in the project (2 m 58s to be exact). Not good at all, but it gives the right answer!
